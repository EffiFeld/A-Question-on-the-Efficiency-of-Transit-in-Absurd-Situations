# Transit Experiment

Hi - first off - apologies for the appearance of this Repo. This was one of the first projects I ever completed and the organization is pretty dismal.
This was completed during the summer I spent studying for the LSAT as a break from the test I never ended up using.

The main idea question is: if I didn't care about logic, which city among DC, NYC, and Philly has the best transit system.
