# Part 2: Shapefiles and Progress {-}


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Septa_logo.png")

```


The main lesson from part 1 is that I'm going to have to be a little less lazy in this project. The minitua is that I needed:
 
   1. a way to graph only the city limits itself  
   2. a way to generate random points within that irregular polygon

Googling told me that what I needed was a shapefile, "The shapefile format is a popular geospatial vector data format for geographic information system (GIS) software...The shapefile format can spatially describe vector features: points, lines, and polygons, representing, for example, water wells, rivers, and lakes."[^4]

At first, it looked like this required me to download a bunch of files from the internet and load them all into R. At first because of the blessed package Tigris which allows users to download shapefiles from the US Census Bureau.

The below code is using the TIGRIS package to grab the files for Philadelphia, New York City, and Washington D.C.
```{r echo = FALSE, message= FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}

grid.arrange(gg_ph, gg_ny, gg_dc, ncol = 3)

```
Okay great - we have our city polygons.
## Getting Random Points {-}
To work with the shapefiles in R, the package `sp` was used. This package has a great function `spsample` which magically spits out the random numbers. At first, I still thought I'd have to figure out how to divide the cities into shapes I could find random points within then recombine.

I thought a good starting point would be to get 300 points, 150 origin and 150 destination, and find the directions between them. I'll show an example of that workflow using only Philadelphia.


```{r, cache = TRUE}
number_sample <- 150  #This is the number of trips we want to test
city_file <- philly #This is what city to get points for

origin <- spsample(city_file, n = number_sample, "random") %>%
  as.data.frame()
origin <- origin %>%
  select(startLat = y , startLon = x) %>%
  mutate(trip_id = 1:nrow(origin))


destination <- spsample(city_file, n = number_sample, "random") %>%
  as.data.frame()
destination <- destination %>%
  select(endLat = y , endLon = x) %>%
  mutate(trip_id = 1:nrow(destination))

#To combine the origins and destinations
trip <- left_join(origin,destination,by = "trip_id") %>%
  select(trip_id,startLat, startLon, endLat, endLon)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE,warning = FALSE}
trip1 <- trip %>%
  select("start latitude" = startLat, "start longitude" = startLon,  "end latitude" = endLat, "end longitude" = endLon )

datatable(trip1, options = list(
  dom = 't'
))
```
<br>

```{r, echo = FALSE}
origin <- origin %>%
  select(latitude = startLat, longitude = startLon, trip_id)%>%
  mutate(type = rep("origin"))
destination <- destination %>%
  select(latitude = endLat, longitude = endLon, trip_id)%>%
  mutate(type = rep("destination"))

loc_both <- rbind(origin, destination) 


city_origin_destination <- gg_ph + 
  geom_point(data = loc_both, aes(longitude, latitude, group = type, color =type), size =  1.5)+
  scale_color_manual(values=c("#db7918", "#1dbdf7"))

city_origin_destination  
```

Now if we want to view the "routes" themselves if the one went as the bird flew.

```{r, echo = FALSE}


trip_a2b_lines <- city_origin_destination +
  geom_path(data=loc_both, aes(x=longitude, y=latitude, group=trip_id), size=0.5, alpha=0.5, color = "white")

trip_a2b_lines
```

##Getting Routes {-}

So now we have this shit.
great package
google way // attaches to google api

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#loading a predone dataframe so that the document doesn't
#ping the API everytime I reknit...or ever really

```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
googleway_raw_data <- lapply(1:nrow(trip), function(x){
  
  google_distance(origin = (locations[x, 2:3]),
                  destination = (locations[x, 4:5]),
                  key = key,
                  mode = "transit")
  
})

```
This results in a list of lists where each holds the data of 1 trip.
```{r}
googleway_raw_data[[5]] #looking at the fifth list, which is also the fifth set of coordinates
```

So, some serious data munging is needed... *cue the montage music*

```{r, warning= FALSE}
foo <- do.call(what = "rbind",
               args = lapply(googleway_raw_data, as.data.frame))

foo <-  separate(foo, elements, into = c("km", "value", "duration", 
                    "value2", "currency", "cost", "uk", "status2"), ",")


foo <- 
  select(foo, destination_addresses, origin_addresses, km, duration, cost, status)
head(foo)
```

Now to get rid of all that annoying fluff[^5]

```{r}
##source of numextract function: http://stla.github.io/stlapblog/posts/Numextract.html
numextract <- function(string){ 
  str_extract(string, "\\-*\\d+\\.*\\d*")
} 

foo$km <- lapply(foo$km, numextract)%>%
  as.numeric()
foo$cost <- substring(foo$cost, 11)
foo$cost <- substr(foo$cost,1,nchar(foo$cost)-1) %>%
  as.numeric()
foo$duration <- substring(foo$duration, 26)
foo$duration <- substr(foo$duration,1,nchar(foo$duration)-1)


#Splitting up duration from XX hour(s) XX minute(s), to seperate columns

foo1 <- separate(foo, duration, into = c("hours", "minutes"), sep = -7)
foo1$hours <- gsub("[^0-9]", "", foo1$hours)
foo1$minutes <- gsub("[^0-9]", "",foo1$minutes)
foo1$hours <- as.numeric(foo1$hours)
foo1$minutes <- as.numeric(foo1$minutes)

#for trips that take less than an hour
#doesnt murk with invalid trips because of other apparent NAS
foo1$hours[is.na(foo1$hours)] <- 0

#creating a total minutes section
foo1 <- foo1 %>% 
  mutate(duration_minutes = (hours*60)+minutes)%>%
  mutate(trip_id = 1:nrow(foo1))

#merging with trip to have coordinates
full_AB_GOOGLE <- left_join(foo1, trip,by = "trip_id")

```


```{r, echo=FALSE,warning = FALSE}
full_AB_GOOGLE1 <- full_AB_GOOGLE

full_AB_GOOGLE1$startLat <- round(full_AB_GOOGLE1$startLat, digits = 4)
full_AB_GOOGLE1$startLon <- round(full_AB_GOOGLE1$startLon, digits = 4)
full_AB_GOOGLE1$endLat <- round(full_AB_GOOGLE1$endLat, digits = 4)
full_AB_GOOGLE1$endLon <- round(full_AB_GOOGLE1$endLon, digits = 4)
full_AB_GOOGLE1 <- full_AB_GOOGLE1 %>%
  select(origin_addresses, destination_addresses, duration_minutes, km, cost, startLat, startLon, endLat, endLon)

datatable(full_AB_GOOGLE1, options = list(
  dom = 'ltp'
))
```

## Our first "good" data {-}
Let's take a quick peak at what the data tells us before moving on.

```{r warning = FALSE}
#selecting a few choice variables and adding miles
foo <- full_AB_GOOGLE %>%
  select(trip_id, kilometers = km, duration = duration_minutes, cost)%>%
  mutate(miles = round(kilometers/1.609344, digits =1))

miles <- as.data.frame(c(summary(foo$miles)))
duration <-as.data.frame(c(summary(foo$duration)))
summary1 <- cbind(miles, duration)%>%
  round(digits =2)
colnames(summary1) <- c("miles", "durations")


summary1 %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = FALSE,
                position = "float_right")

```

```{r echo = FALSE, message= FALSE, warning = FALSE}

histx <- 
ggplot(data = foo, aes(duration)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 10, fill = "#1f4fa3")+
  ggtitle("Histogram of Trip Duration")

scatter <- 
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data =foo, aes(x = duration, y = miles), color = "#f14728")+
  ggtitle("Scatterplot of Duration vs. Miles")

grid.arrange(histx, scatter,  ncol = 2)

```
